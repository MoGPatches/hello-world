# hello-world
MoGPatches' Github Introductianza

As I'm sure many have before me, I find myself in this corner of the internet pursuing my homemade 3D printer.  If you have any insights I welcome any help I can get.  This project has turned out to be much larger than I thought it would be.  I'm trying to use recycled parts from the local scrap yard.  Probably should have picked a standard build for my foray into this field.  But what fun would that be?  Details on the way.
